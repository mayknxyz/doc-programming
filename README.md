# Learn Programming: A Personal Knowledge Base

Welcome! This repository is my personal wiki and knowledge base for timeless, language-agnostic programming concepts, system design patterns, and computer science fundamentals.

The purpose is to create a structured, interconnected library of notes to solidify my understanding and serve as a reference for my future self.

### My Workflow
I capture quick, unsorted ideas in the `00-inbox/` folder and later refine them into structured notes within the appropriate category. Each note aims to be atomic and linked to related concepts.
